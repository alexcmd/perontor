#Design Document for Perontor V1

# Introduction #

This is the design document for V1 of Perontor. This is going to be more "boardgame" focused -> keep things _simple_ and _abstract_ for the time being. This should be easier to manage and allow us to test user interface code, etc for later more ambitious versions of the game.

Inspirations:
**chess**     - a small set of well defined playing pieces
**go**        - territory control, influence
**diplomacy** - simple rules allowing for interesting player interactions
**solium infernum** - battling over control of certain tiles on the board
